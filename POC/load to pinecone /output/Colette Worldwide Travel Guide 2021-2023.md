## Oberammergau Passion! / Day 2022

Don't miss out on this once-in-a-
decade experience!
Nested in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, less than a two-hour drive from Munich, the quaint village of Oberammergau is one of Europe's most unique destinations. Every ten years, this town draws visitors from across the globe as host to what is regarded as the most important Passion Play in the world. The Passion Play, an epic event that traces Jesus' life, death and resurrection, is a moving feast of drama and music.

In 1653 soldiers returning home from the Thirty Years War brought with them the Black Plaque. After much death and suffering, leaders of the community in Oberammergau came together, Hedging to hold a play honoring the life of Christ every ten years. From that dayforward, no additional villagers perished from the plaque. The event continues today with performers all native to the village.

When you choose one of our special departures that includes the Passion Play, you'll receive your ticket and stay right in Oberammergau at a hotel conveniently located near the auditorium. The auditorium where the play will be held offers comfortable seats set on an incline, providing everyone with a good view. During a break in the performance, you'll join your fellow travelers for dinner before returning for the remainder of your Passion Play performance. This powerful play is not to be missed.

# (2) FREQUENTLY ASKED questions 

## accommodations

What is the difference between a twin room and a double room? In certain countries, hotel rooms tend to be smaller than U.S. standard accommodations. A double room is designed to accommodate two people, but may not have two separate beds. A twin bedded room has two separate beds of any size, and is the type most commonly utilized.
What size is a triple room? A triple room is the same size as a twin bedded room and beds will accommodate three people, but we cannot guarantee that there will be three separate beds. If there are only two beds, a rollaway may be requested but cannot be guaranteed due to size of room and fire codes. Please inquire at time of reservation.
Can my children travel on tour? Children over the age of 5 may travel on a Collette tour accompanied by an adult. Child land rates are valid for ages 5-12, sharing a room with two full-paying adults.
Are single and triple rooms always available? On many tours, triple and single accommodations are limited and are available on a first come, first served basis. Be advised that single rooms are often smaller.
When can I check into my hotel? Normal check-in time is late afternoon in most locations. Due to early arrival times into some cities, rooms may not always be available for immediate check-in.

## air

Can Collette book our airline reservations? Collette is happy to assist you in accommodating your flight needs. Due to tour scheduling and limited availability, you are strongly encouraged to take advantage of Collette's air packages. We are not responsible for air arrangements you have made on your own. On occasion, it is necessary to change tour dates. In this case, we can only protect air reservations booked through Collette. For all air reservations, it is strongly recommended to reconfirm flights before departure, in the event that the airline has an unexpected schedule change. We cannot assume responsibility for schedule changes, routings or flight cancellations involving the airlines. Not all airlines offer pre-assigned seats. Some charge a fee for seats which will be at the guests' expense. Where pre-assigned seats are not offered, the guests must contact the airline directly to arrange seat assignments.

## attractions \& sightseeing

Are attractions always available? Access to some attractions or Collette Foundation sites may be affected by the observance of holidays, weather conditions or other circumstances. As a result, the days and order of sightseeing may change to best utilize your time on tour. Boat rides are weather permitting. Some attractions may not be available during the "off-season" months. When attractions are unavailable, other similar attractions will be substituted. Wildlife sightings are not guaranteed.
Is there a lot of walking on tour? We pride ourselves on bringing travelers the very best experiences a destination offers. Our itineraries include many activities and may consist of walking on uneven terrain or significant walking at times. Some of the most unique sightseeing can mean accessing locations that restrict motorcoaches, especially in historic areas. Some hotels/lodges in remote locations may not have elevators. For your comfort, we recommend bringing walking shoes. Review each tour's "Tour Activity Level" and "Tour Pacing" on the tour itinerary webpage.
Can you tell me more about the safaris? In order to most fully experience the wildlife, you will be traveling by custom-built safari vehicle which requires climbing in and out frequently and sometimes travels on bumpy roads. To experience Africa fully, we recommend that all travelers be in reasonably good health and prepare properly.

How can I plan for shore landings? Special clothing is required for the shore landings (Antarctica, Galapagos); please refer to your predeparture documents for important details.
Are all theater performances suitable for children? Some theater performances may be unsuitable for children - consult your Tour Manager.

## documentation

Do I need a passport? Government-issued identification is required for all air travel. A valid passport is required for all trips outside the USA. All passengers should check with the appropriate foreign consulate for entry and validity requirements. We recommend that your passport has six months validity, and at least 3 blank pages. Passports and visas are the responsibility of each client.
International Borders Any child under age 16 (traveling without a parent or legal guardian to Canada) must have written permission from a parent or legal guardian.
Please be advised that if you have been convicted of an offense, or have committed a criminal act that is an offense under the laws where it occurred and would be an offense in Canada, you may be inadmissible into Canada. You will need to apply for a Minister's Permit of Approval of Rehabilitation at a Canadian Consulate. All other travelers should contact the appropriate consulate for entry requirements in other international destinations.
In South Africa, children are required to have a passport as well as additional documentation to travel with you into and out of the country. Please consult the South African Embassy for the current specific requirements related to your travel dates.
If traveling internationally with a child under the age of 18, please check directly with the airline for the legal documentation that is required. It is the sole responsibility of the guest to procure the proper documentation to travel and many requirements vary by airline and destination.
Collette will not be responsible for costs incurred for missed flights or canceled tours where a guest fails to secure proper documentation.

## extending your stay

Can I extend my tour to see more of a region? Yes! You may enhance your tour by purchasing either an extension or pre/post hotel stays, offered on select tours. Extensions may be "hosted" rather than escorted. When hosted, passengers will be greeted upon arrival by a local tour manager who will provide all included services and be available on-call during the duration of the extension. A minimum number of passengers may be required to operate some extensions. Extensions not purchased at time of deposit are subject to availability and applicable charges at time of request.
Collette also offers pre and post hotel nights before and/or after a tour for you to explore the destination independently. Should you purchase additional nights, please be advised that your Tour Manager will not be available during this time.

## extras

What is not included in the tour price? The land price does not include air travel, airline fees, airport or departure taxes, transfers, visas, customary end-oftrip gratuities for your Tour Manager, driver, local guides, hotel housekeepers, cruise ship waitstaff, and any incidental charges.

## late bookings

Do you accept late bookings? Tour sales normally close 7 days prior to departure. All late bookings are on request and must be guaranteed with a credit card if within 60 days of departure date.

## Page 95

## on-tour experience

Where do I meet my Tour Manager? Your tour will begin at your first hotel. The Tour Manager will make contact with you at the hotel and will provide details relating to your tour. The hotel's address and phone number will be included in your documents.
Can I pre purchase optional excursions/activities? Yes, the majority of optional excursions and activities are available for advance purchase for applicable tours provided that you make your options purchase prior to 15 days of the tour departure. Collette makes it convenient to reserve presold options by visiting our website for a full listing of activities and excursions or when your reservation is made with our reservations staff. In addition, there are benefits to prepurchasing options including a price guarantee once your tour is paid in full. So, while the cost of an optional activity may change from the time you book your tour, once payment is received in full, your preselected options are guaranteed by Collette at their original price. Although you can still purchase options while on tour, reserving them ahead of time ensures you a spot in the event that the activity sells out. Collette will provide a refund if you cancel a presold option prior to tour departure. Any presold options canceled while on tour are nonrefundable.

## revisions/changes

Would my tour date ever be changed? While it is unlikely, Collette does reserve the right to cancel a tour prior to departure. Should this happen, Collette will make every effort to put you on another departure date. If an alternate cannot be found, a full refund will be made. Air booked through Collette will be protected. We cannot be held responsible for penalties incurred if you have secured your own air.
Can I make changes to my reservation? Should you decide to change your reservation after initial booking, a handling fee of $\$ 25$ per transaction will be charged. A change of tour date, tour itinerary or passenger name, within the guidelines of the cancellation policy, will be treated as a cancellation and regular cancellation fees may apply.
Revisions to air tickets are subject to the rules and regulations of the airline. See our Cancellation Policy for more details.

## tour pacing

How can I be best prepared for the pacing and physical requirements on a Collette tour? Tour pacing varies by itinerary, and each destination's sightseeing and activities are unique. Pacing is subject to personal interpretation. At Collette, we do include the best a destination has to offer, enhancing your overall tour experience. For overnight pacing of a tour, as well as day-by-day descriptions of the tour, please refer to our website.
The Tour Activity Level Ranking is featured on each tour itinerary webpage in a circle. The definition of each activity level is listed here. If you have additional questions regarding a specific tour, please inquire at time of reservation. For your comfort, we recommend packing comfortable walking shoes so you can fully enjoy every aspect of your tour.
Level 1: You're a leisurely traveler. You like to discover the energy of a new place, but typically take it easy. You can handle at least one flight of stairs, board a coach, and walk for 15-30 minutes at a time with little difficulty.
Level 2: You like a balanced approach to travel. You feel confident walking at least 30-45 minutes at a time over a variety of terrains - from cobblestone
streets to easy straightaways to a couple hills or flights of stairs. You're comfortable walking a few city blocks at a time, but need some time to unwind and relax.
Level 3: You're an on-the-go traveler. You don't want to miss a thing, so walking and standing for longer periods of time (1-2 hours) isn't a big deal. You can navigate hills and uneven ground, climb into various modes of transportation (tuk-tuk, cable car, zodiac, etc.), and could possibly anticipate changes in elevation. You can expect some longer days balanced with freetime to recharge or set out on your own adventure.
Level 4: You're ready to seize the day, whatever it may bring. You lead an active life at home (walking, biking, and hiking are things you may enjoy) and few thousand steps a day isn't out of the norm. You can handle longer walking tours (more than 90 minutes), traversing dusty or uneven terrain, standing for periods of time, varying altitudes and temperatures, and don't mind being on the go with some early starts, late-night experiences, and full days. Unfortunately, this level is not appropriate for individuals who use wheelchairs or walkers.

## transfers

Are airport and hotel transfers available? Roundtrip airport-to-hotel transfers are provided for all passengers who purchase airfare through Collette. These transfers also apply to pre- and post-night stays purchased through Collette.

## Part A Waiver Only provided by Collette Travel Service, Inc.;

The Pre-Departure Cancellation Fee Waiver is provided by Collette, is not an insurance benefit and is not underwritten by United States Fire Insurance Company. Payment of a per person Travel Protection Plan fee guarantees a full refund of all payments (including deposit), except the Travel Protection Plan fee itself, made to Collette for travel arrangements in case of cancellation of your travel plans for any reason prior to the day of departure. The Cancellation Fee Waiver reimburses airline tickets you have purchased from Collette.
Exception: If you originally purchased Instant Purchase airline tickets, this Part A Travel Protection Plan does not provide a refund for the airline tickets, taxes or fees, in the event of a cancellation. This air ticket may be covered by Collette's Travel Protection Plan under Part B, if you cancel your trip for covered reasons (see Part B for more details).
The Part A Waiver portion of Collette's Travel Protection Plan protects you from penalties in the event you have a need to cancel your entire inclusive tour package up to the day prior to departure. The Part A Waiver portion of the Travel Protection Plan does not intentionally you from penalties if you choose to cancel partial tour components or air. If you choose to partially cancel your tour, you will be responsible for a revision fee as well as any penalties that are incurred at the time of the cancellation.
For Residents of MN, MO, NY and WA Only: The Pre-Departure Cancellation Fee Waiver (Part A) can be purchased separately without the purchase of the Travel Protection Plan. Contact Collette at 1-800-8324656 in order to purchase the Pre-Departure Cancellation Fee Waiver separately.
Collette's Part A Waiver portion of the Travel Protection Plan does not reimburse any single supplement charges which arise from an individual's traveling companion electing to cancel for any reason prior to departure. In this case, the single supplement will be deducted from the refund of

the person who cancels. (However, the Part B Benefits referenced below include a single supplement benefit for certain covered reasons, as detailed in Part B.) Division of this charge between the two passengers involved is solely their responsibility. If insufficient funds are deducted from the canceling client, the traveling client will be charged the remaining portion of the single supplement.
Your payment for the Travel Protection Plan (if chosen) must be received by Collette with your deposit. The fee is non-refundable, nontransferable and valid for each applicant only.
Collette can assume no responsibility for and cannot be held liable for any wrongful, negligent or unauthorized acts or omissions of any travel agent or travel agency other than that of Collette Travel Service, Inc. itself, and its own employees.
